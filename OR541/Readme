This project was about helping a computer chip company called Superchip save money in how they make and deliver their chips.  They had five 
factories across Virginia, 30 types of chips, and customers all over the U.S.  The problem was that every factory was making every chip without 
thinking about which factory was cheaper or closer to customers, which made the costs very high. To fix this, I used data and some optimization 
techniques to figure out a smarter way: each factory should focus on making the chips it can produce the cheapest, and shipments should go from 
the closest factory. When we tested this new plan, the company could save over 20% of its total costs and still meet customer demand, even if 
demand grew by 10%. We also suggested adding new equipment in Richmond, since it gave the best cost savings, and putting new technology in 
Alexandria, since it was the most expensive to run. In short, we turned their complicated and costly process into a much more efficient and 
cost-friendly one.
